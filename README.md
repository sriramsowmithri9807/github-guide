2. Name your repository.
3. Add a description (optional).
4. Choose to initialize with a README file.
5. Click "Create repository."

## Cloning a Repository

To work on a project locally:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

## Making Changes

1. Make changes to the files in your local repository using your preferred code editor.
2. Save your changes.

## Committing Changes

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Use the following commands:

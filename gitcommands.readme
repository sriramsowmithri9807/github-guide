GITHUB COMMANDS BEGINEER TO ADVANCE 
# GitHub Commands Guide: From Beginner to Advanced

## Introduction

GitHub, powered by Git, is a robust platform for version control and collaborative coding. This guide will take you through a series of GitHub commands, from basic to advanced, empowering you to manage your repositories effectively.

### Basics

#### 1. **`git init`**
   - Initializes a new Git repository.

#### 2. **`git clone <repository_url>`**
   - Clones a repository from a URL to your local machine.

#### 3. **`git add <file>`**
   - Stages changes for the next commit.

#### 4. **`git commit -m "Your message here"`**
   - Commits staged changes with a descriptive message.

#### 5. **`git push origin <branch_name>`**
   - Pushes committed changes to the remote repository.

#### 6. **`git pull origin <branch_name>`**
   - Fetches changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local branch.

### Branching

#### 7. **`git branch`**
   - Lists all local branches, highlighting the current one.

#### 8. **`git branch <branch_name>`**
   - Creates a new branch.

#### 9. **`git checkout <branch_name>`**
   - Switches to the specified branch.

#### 10. **`git merge <branch_name>`**
    - Merges changes from the specified branch into the current one.

### Collaboration

#### 11. **`git remote -v`**
    - Lists all remote repositories connected to your local repository.

#### 12. **`git fetch`**
    - Fetches changes from the remote repository.

#### 13. **`git pull --rebase origin <branch_name>`**
    - Fetches changes and rebases your local changes on top of the fetched changes.

#### 14. **`git push --force origin <branch_name>`**
    - Force-pushes changes to the remote repository (use with caution).

### Advanced Workflows

#### 15. **`git rebase -i HEAD~<number_of_commits>`**
    - Interactively rewrites commit history.

#### 16. **`git cherry-pick <commit_hash>`**
    - Applies changes from a specific commit to the current branch.

#### 17. **`git stash`**
    - Temporarily saves changes, allowing you to switch branches without committing.

#### 18. **`git submodule add <repository_url>`**
    - Adds a submodule to your repository.

### Inspecting Changes

#### 19. **`git log`**
    - Displays the commit history.

#### 20. **`git diff`**
    - Shows changes between working directory, staging area, and the last commit.

#### 21. **`git blame <file>`**
    - Displays who changed which line and when.

### Resolving Conflicts

#### 22. **`git merge --abort`**
    - Aborts the merge operation, reverting changes.

#### 23. **`git mergetool`**
    - Opens a visual tool to help resolve merge conflicts.

### GitHub Actions

#### 24. **`.github/workflows`**
    - Create GitHub Actions workflows to automate tasks.

#### 25. **`git tag -a <tag_name> -m "Release version x.y.z"`**
    - Tags a specific commit for versioning.

### Git Aliases

#### 26. **`git config --global - alias.<alias_name> <git_command>`**
    - Creates aliases for frequently used commands.

### Conclusion

Mastering these GitHub commands will enhance your ability to navigate complex version control scenarios. Remember to use them wisely and always consider the collaborative nature of GitHub when making changes. Happy coding!
